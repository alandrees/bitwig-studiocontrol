Bitwig Studio Control
=====================

Script to expose each of the different MIDI controllers I have as inputs in Bitwig, separating the different devices on different channels.

The Devices are:

Axiom 49 v1

Axiom 49 v2

Axiom 25

Roland TD-4

The API versions are tagged at the last commit that was compatable with the version.

So the most updated, version 1 code would be apiv1 tag.
